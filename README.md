Hello! Welcome to the Lionmap package, we're so excited to have you here!

This package is meant to enable easy, consistent and robust cell type mapping using a reference dataset.

The package only works using BPCells matrices as input. BPCells is a package that enables fast gene expression transformations and IO operations while requiring little memory on your computing environment. For more info on BPCells, check out the package [here](https://bnprks.github.io/BPCells/).

Easy install:

1) install the remotes library 2) enter: remotes::install_github("jonathan-columbiau/lionmap")

If that doesn't work, there are some packages you have to manually install in order to get Lionmap to work properly. All of them are available as repositories either on Github, Bioconductor, or CRAN (if the easy install option doesn't work). See the error message you're getting for the names of the package you have to install manually.
